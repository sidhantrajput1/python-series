# print("Hello World"); 
# print("i'm coder", "and you?");
# print(34*4);

# name = "sidhant"
# age = 21
# gender = "Male"
# marks = 85.22;
# print("My name is : ",name, "my age is : ",age, "gender is : ",gender)

# print(type(name), type(age), type(marks));


# a = 10;
# b = 2;
# sum = a + b;
# print(sum);
# print(a*b);
# print(a**b);

# x = 5
# y = 10 
# print(x == y)


# num = 10;
# num  += 10;
# print(num);

# a = 5
# b = 1.5
# sum1 =  a + b 
#provide error
# c = int(b) 
#change in integer value
# print(a + c);

# name = input("Enter Your Name : ")
# print("Welcome", name)

a = int(input("Enter a : "))

b = int(input("Enter b : "))

print(a+b)
